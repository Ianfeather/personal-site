<p>Last Saturday, in a canyon of a hangover, I decided to <a href='http://ianfeather.co.uk/hangover-hack/'>ditch my client work and just make something fun</a>. I&#8217;d encourage others to do the same. Maybe not <I>in favour</I> of client work but do try and make some time just to play around, experiment and recapture that feeling of why you first got enraptured by the web.</p>
<blockquote class='pull-quote'>It's fun to just mess about with code like no one is watching. That was the real lesson.</blockquote>
<p>I gave myself a few guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not to get wrapped up in best practices</li>

<li>Chose speed of development over maintainability. In fact, ignore maintainability.</li>

<li>First thought, best thought.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last is one I borrowed from Jack Kerouac. I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to build and so it made sense to make the outcome an organic production of my erratic, pickled in alcohol, thought process.</p>

<p>I wanted to build something involving images so I dragged out an old chunk of code from a previous project and tapped into the Flickr api. I liked the idea of being able to build a grid of photos based on some parameters. Maybe based on recent keywords from a twitter stream or using geolocation. I started out with just a search box and a lazy grid built of four columns with a ragged y endpoint. A cheat of a solution but I was determined to cheat where possible: I wanted quick development and iteration.</p>

<p>Once I had the gallery mode working on search I got distracted by the idea of using filters to see if you could create instagram like photos with CSS. I could have used a js library but had heard that chrome canary had introduced support for CSS filters so I fired it up and built a little webkit only control panel, a grin on my face from the anarchic approach I was taking in light of recent industry dialogue on the matter.</p>

<h2 id='what_i_learned'>What I learned?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s fun to just mess about with code like no one is watching. That was the real lesson.</p>

<h2 id='what_improvements_would_i_make'>What improvements would I make?</h2>

<p>It took around 6 hours to make, although I split that time with 6 nations rugby, but if I had had more time I&#8217;d build in instagram support and add the ability to switch back and forth between the two modes more easily.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll add that in the future but it&#8217;s more likely I&#8217;ll just build something new. Either way, in the future, I&#8217;ll definitely be building something just for the sake of it.</p>
