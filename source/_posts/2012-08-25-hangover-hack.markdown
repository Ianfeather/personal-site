I'm hungover, on crutches and my girlfriend is at work. I have loads of client work to deal with and by rights that is what today should involve but instead I'm going to do something different, something I rarely do.

I'm going to make something *FUN*.

For no other reason. I'm just going to take a few hours out and see what comes up at the far end. Maybe it's something I should do more often, something everyone should do more often. Let's see.

The six nations is on tv and I've got a cup of tea on the go. Hopefully writing this will mean that I actually do it rather than getting caught up in other bits.

Ps. Sorry to my clients in advance.
