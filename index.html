  <div><p>The smoke hung to the ceiling, the smokiness of the whisky clung to the back of our throats. The comfort of the walls liberated our expression. We were conspiring, and madness dared to precede us.</p>

<p>Conspiring on change, deliberating on decision, gathering our thoughts for the future of the web: as we could each see it. Tongues flew fast on the back of ideas and tangents. We bounced from process to product, from theory to theatre and concepts had their potential amplified by each discourse.</p>

<p>Some of us sat up, stood, paced, drew wildly on the walls. Others stared at the floor and shook their heads, looking up to interject in the vein of &#8216;Exactly!&#8217;, &#8216;Tell that to the world&#8217; or &#8216;Pass me the bottle&#8217;.</p>

<p>Can we ever recreate this fast flowing and fluid communication through a remote medium? Do remote teams suffer as a consequence?</p>

<p>Last Saturday, in a canyon of a hangover, I decided to <a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/hangover-hack/">ditch my client work and just make something fun</a>. I&#8217;d encourage others to do the same. Maybe not <I>in favour</I> of client work but do try and make some time just to play around, experiment and recapture that feeling of why you first got enraptured by the web.</p>

<p>I gave myself a few guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not to get wrapped up in best practices</li>
<li>Chose speed of development over maintainability. In fact, ignore maintainability.</li>
<li>First thought, best thought.</li>
</ul>


<p>The last is one I borrowed from Jack Kerouac. I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to build and so it made sense to make the outcome an organic production of my erratic, pickled in alcohol, thought process.</p>

<p>I wanted to build something involving images so I dragged out an old chunk of code from a previous project and tapped into the Flickr api. I liked the idea of being able to build a grid of photos based on some parameters. Maybe based on recent keywords from a twitter stream or using geolocation. I started out with just a search box and a lazy grid built of four columns with a ragged y endpoint. A cheat of a solution but I was determined to cheat where possible: I wanted quick development and iteration.</p>

<p>Once I had the gallery mode working on search I got distracted by the idea of using filters to see if you could create instagram like photos with CSS. I could have used a js library but had heard that chrome canary had introduced support for CSS filters so I fired it up and built a little webkit only control panel, a grin on my face from the anarchic approach I was taking in light of recent industry dialogue on the matter.</p>

<h2>What I learned?</h2>

<p>That it&#8217;s fun to just mess about with code like no one is watching. That was the real lesson.</p>

<h2>What improvements would I make?</h2>

<p>It took around 6 hours to make, although I split that time with 6 nations rugby, but if I had had more time I&#8217;d build in instagram support and add the ability to switch back and forth between the two modes more easily.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll add that in the future but it&#8217;s more likely I&#8217;ll just build something new. Either way, in the future, I&#8217;ll definitely be building something just for the sake of it.</p>

  <div><p>I&#8217;m hungover, on crutches and my girlfriend is at work. I have loads of client work to deal with and by rights that is what today should involve but instead I&#8217;m going to do something different, something I rarely do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make something <em>FUN</em>.</p>

<p>For no other reason. I&#8217;m just going to take a few hours out and see what comes up at the far end. Maybe it&#8217;s something I should do more often, something everyone should do more often. Let&#8217;s see.</p>

<p>The six nations is on tv and I&#8217;ve got a cup of tea on the go. Hopefully writing this will mean that I actually do it rather than getting caught up in other bits.</p>

<p>Ps. Sorry to my clients in advance.</p>
